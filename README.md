 Search for unclaimed ETH extremely fast

## About
This app allows you to search for unclaimed ETH in randomly generated wallets (by generating a random 64 hex string) and check each generated wallet's balance instantly using etherscan. If a wallet with more than 0 ETH is found, it's saved to a log file and you can import it using any ethereum wallet (such as MetaMask).

This tool is heavily optimized to get the maximum generation speed and further increase your chances of finding a wallet with balance.

## Feedback and Donations
If you have any suggestions or found any bugs, please let me know

Please consider donating, I worked on this app alone and it would mean so much to me if I get even just a small tip!

My ETH Address: 0x56030bC0d8d38d9A1854767a667AD9C1A734964D

Thank you very much! :)
